# DPDASimulation
A program that allows a user to enter a description of a deterministic pushdown automaton followed by a sequence of input symbols.  After each input symbol the program will display the current state and the contents of the stack.  At the end of input, the program will indicate whether the dpda ended in an accepting state.
